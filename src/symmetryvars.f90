! numbering according to International Tables for Crystallography
! [hexagonal groups in rhombohedral setting
! are described in locations 231-237]
! 
! The space group information is encoded in the following way:
! From the International Crystallographic Tables one finds that
! the point symmetry parts of the space group generators are 
! represented by 14 out of 71 different matrices.  When expressed 
! in the crystallographic reference frame, those matrices contain 
! only the entries 1, 0, and -1.  
! 
! The 14 matrices are represented by the lower case 
! letters a through n. (see program and Appendix A3, page 666, for details)
! The translational parts of the space group generators are limited
! to the following set (encoded with upper-case letters):
! 
! A             1/6
! B             1/4
! C             1/3
! D             1/2
! E             2/3
! F             3/4
! G             5/6
! O             0
! X             -3/8
! Y             -1/4
! Z             -1/8
!
! SYM_GENnum     = number of generator matrices
! SYM_MATnum     = number of non-zero symmetry matrices
! SYM_NUMpt      = number of point group operators
! SYM_reduce     = switch to enable/disable reduction to fundamental cell
! SYM_trigonal   = switch for hexagonal vs. rhombohedral settings
! SYM_second     = switch for second setting of spacegroup (if any)
! SYM_c          = dummy 4x4 matrix used for various computations
! SYM_data       = all symmetry matrices for a given spacegroup
! SYM_direc      = direct space point group matrices
! SYM_recip      = reciprocal space point group matrices
! SYM_SGname     = all space group names
! SYM_name       = current space group name
