This archive contains the complete CTEMsoft library, and 
application programs corresponding to chapters 1 through 4
of the CTEM book.

After unpacking the archive, you will find three folders:

doc
exe
src

The doc folder contains this README file and, in the future,
will contain more detailed information in PDF format.

The exe folder will contain all executables after compilation.

The src file contains all source code, including the makefiles.


To compile the package, you must first edit the following 
file:

m.routines

In the section "USER CONFIGURABLE PARAMETERS", you should 
change the pathname so that CTEM points to the main CTEMsoft folder.

Then change the compiler names, and also the location of the LAPACK
and BLAS libraries, which are needed for the CTEMsoft package to compile.
Many systems have these libraries pre-installed, but if you don't have
them, you can get them from www.netlib.org.  

The FFTW libraries can be obtained from www.fftw.org.

Finally, you should change the optimization switches for your f90
compiler.

Now you are ready to compile the entire package, which should be
as simple as typing   make all   at the command line.  Sit back
and wait until the whole thing is done.

So far, the entire package has been tested on COMPAQ TRU64, on Linux Red Hat,
and on Mac OSX.  If there are compilation problems, you should try to 
resolve them, and then notify me, so that I can make whatever changes
necessary to the source code.
